# amazon_clone

I recreated Amazonâ€™s homepage using only HTML and CSS to strengthen my frontend development skills. This project helped me understand the importance of layout structuring, flexbox, and responsive design. It was a great exercise in replicating real-world UI elements and improving attention to design details.
